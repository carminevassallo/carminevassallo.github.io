Hi, I am Carmine Vassallo. I am a senior DevOps engineer at [Avaloq](https://www.avaloq.com/en/home), part of NEC Corporation, in Zurich. We build our own software banking suite which is used by Barclays, HSBC, and other major banks worldwide. In my role, I take ownership of build tools and architect the next automation tasks, fostering a DevOps mindset.

I hold a PhD in computer science from the University of Zurich.
